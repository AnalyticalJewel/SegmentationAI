## Project Overview
SegmentationAI is a comprehensive project aimed at identifying key customer segments for a subscription/product-based app/web company. By understanding the behavior and preferences of each segment, this project will help in forming and optimixing marketing strategies to increase customer retention and satisfaction.

## Objectives
1. **Identify Key Customer Segments:** Using clustering techniques to group customers based on service subscription patterns, performance, and behavior.
2. **Understand Segment Behavior:** Analyzing customer data to uncover the behavior and preferences within each identified segment.
3. **Forming and optimizing  Marketing Strategies:** Developing and applying targeted marketing strategies for each segment to enhance customer engagement.
4. **Increase Retention and Satisfaction:** Predicting customer retention and satisfaction to optimize marketing and business strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
1. **Python**: For data preprocessing, model training, and analysis.
2. **MySQL**: To perform complex queries, extract insights, and manage data.
3. **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data exploration and simple analysis.
4. **Tableau**: For data visualization and presenting the results.

## Machine Learning Models
1. **K-Means Clustering**: To identify key customer segments.
2. **Decision Trees**: To understand the behavior and preferences within each segment.
3. **Logistic Regression**: To predict the effectiveness of tailored marketing strategies.
4. **Random Forest**: For predicting customer retention and satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various columns such as Customer ID, Age, Gender, Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount (USD), Location, Size, Color, Season, Review Rating, Subscription Status, Shipping Type, Discount Applied, Promo Code Used, Previous Purchases, Payment Method, and Frequency of Purchases.

## Project Roadmap
1. **Data Collection & Preparation**: Import the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing like encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use Python and SQL to explore and visualize the dataset, identifying key patterns and correlations.
3. **Segmentation Using K-Means**: Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on subscription patterns, performance, and behavior.
4. **Behavioral Analysis Using Decision Trees**: Analyze the behavior and preferences of each segment using Decision Trees.
5. **Marketing Strategy Development using Logistic Regression**:Predict the effectiveness of marketing strategies tailored for each segment.
6. **Retention & Satisfaction Prediction Using Random Forest**: Predict customer retention and satisfaction using Random Forest.
7. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Perform complex SQL queries to extract deeper insights and prepare data for further analysis.
8. **Visualization in Tableau**: Visualize the results of each objective using Tableau, focusing on customer segments, behavior patterns, marketing strategy outcomes, and retention predictions.
